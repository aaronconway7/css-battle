These are my solutions to CSSBatlle. The objective of the game is to write HTML/CSS to replicate the given target image in the least code possible. You can find my answers for each round by going to that specific branch in this repo.

As you score more points for less characters, you'll probably find that most of my solutions aren't the *highest* scoring as I want to make them somewhat readable and easy to follow (e.g. you can get penalised by giving descriptive class names compared to short ones). I'll mainly be aiming just to get a 100% match.
